## Project Overview
This project analyses Olist’s e-commerce data from Brazil to understand customer behavior, identify churn risks, and recommend strategies to improve customer retention and sales growth.
The analysis is built using multiple Olist datasets and visualized in Power BI, highlighting customer insights through RFM segmentation (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) and key performance indicators (KPIs).

## Objectives

- Understand customer purchasing patterns.
- Identify one-time buyers vs. repeat customers.
- Analyze payment behavior and customer satisfaction.
- Develop strategies to increase loyalty and reduce churn.


## Tools & Techniques

- Power BI for data modeling, cleaning, and visualization
- RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) for customer segmentation
- KPI tracking to measure improvements in customer retention
- DAX formulas for calculated metrics and segmentation logic

## Key Insights

- 74% of customers are one-time buyers (retention challenge)
- Credit card is the most preferred payment method, followed by boleto.
- Health & Beauty, Bed Bath & Table, and Sports & Leisure are top-performing product categories with high positive reviews.

## KPI Goals

- **Recency:** Increase the share of recent customers to 10%
- **Frequency:** Grow the percentage of frequent buyers to 5% 
- **Monetary:** Increase the share of big spenders to 15% 


## Recommendations

- Strengthen partnerships with major banks to offer better installment plans, credit card rewards, and promotional rates.
- Encourage boleto users to switch to digital payments with faster processing and special incentives.
- Expand top categories (Bed Bath & Table, Health & Beauty, Sports & Leisure) through targeted marketing and influencer collaborations.
- Improve recency by offering short-term discounts with limited expiration periods.
- Enhance loyalty programs with reward points for every purchase to increase repeat buying.
